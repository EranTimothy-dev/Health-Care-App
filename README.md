<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a basic health care application built with java. This project helped me learn about the foundational concepts in Java, and it helped me to understand how Object-Oriented Programming works in Java.
This is an ongoing project I do plan to improve this in the future. As of now it runs on the terminal but a graphical user interface may be implemented with future updates so stay tunedðŸ˜Š.

Upcoming Features:
* User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
* Storing details to a permanent Database.
* Possible other feature improvements to make the appointment making and viewing process more smooth.
