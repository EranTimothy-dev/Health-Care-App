<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a basic health care application built with java. This project helped me learn about the foundational concepts in Java.
This is an ongoing project I do plan to improve this in the future. As of now it runs on the terminal but a graphical user interface may be implemented with future updates so stay tunedðŸ˜Š.

Completed so far:
* Takes and stores details of doctors.
* Finished certain menu options.
* Implemented OOP at its most basic basic level.
